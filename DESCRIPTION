Description: This package is an extension of the VARPP (https://github.com/deniando/VARPP) model. Whole genome and exome sequencing are now standard tools in the diagnostic process of 
    patients suffering from rare and other genetic disorders. The bottleneck for succesfull diagnosis is finding the disease causing variants amongst tens of thousands of genetic variants returned
    by such tests. One step in this process is to pre-filter the variants based on known benign/non-disease causing variants.  
    This package, similar to the original VARPP code, focuses on the task of prioritising variants in respect to the observed disease phenotype(s), after applying the pre-filtering step.  
    This package links gene expression across multiple tissues and cell types to the phenotypes, hence the name (VAR)iant (P)rioritisation by (P)henotype. It can prioritise potential disease causing
    variants in a personalised manner.
    On top of the original task of prioritising variants, this version 2 of VARPP also returns a set of Rules that led to the prioritisation of the variants. This is based on the work by Fiedman and Popescu (Friedman JH, Popescu BE. Predictive learning via rule ensembles. The Annals of Applied Statistics. 2008;2(3):916-54.).
