## Installation

To install, type the following into `R` or `RStudio`:

```r
devtools::install_github("Hobbeist/varppRule")
```

## Human Phenotype Ontology and related genes  
In order to run RuleFit and VARPP and get a prediction for pathogenic variants, one needs to retrieve a list of genes that are associated with the HPO term of interest. Just provide a vector of genes to the model and it will return the prediction.

The list of genes can either be retrieved manually from https://hpo.jax.org/, or by using the `phenolyzer` software.


## Run RuleFit

```r
# Load the package
library(varppRule)

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Run the function

rulefit_results <- rule_fit(HPO_genes,
                            ntree = 200,
                            max.depth = 3,
                            rule.filter = 10,
                            bootstrap.rounds = 100,
                            rule.extract.cores = 4,
                            kappa.cores = 2,
                            lasso.cores = 4,
                            ranger.and.rulefit = FALSE
                            )

```

## Run VARPP
```r

varpp_results <- varpp(HPO_genes,
                       ntree = 2000,
                       max.depth = NULL,
                       cores = 4
                      )
                  
```

## Results

The below is an exemplary output from ```varppRule``` for HP:0000002.
Using the ```varpp_report``` function allows to generate an html report based on this output,
which includes more detailed information on the model statistics.

=========================================

Model call: 
rule_fit(data = gtex_data, y = "Pathogenic", two_level_bootstrap = TRUE, 
    ntree = ntree, max.depth = maxdepth, rule.filter = rules, 
    bootstrap.rounds = lasso, rule.extract.cores = 16, kappa.cores = 10, 
    lasso.cores = 16, ranger.and.rulefit = FALSE, report = FALSE)
```

## Predict
Once the model is trained on the HPO term related genes, we can use the model to predict on patient data:

```
predict.varppRule(patient_data, 
                  model_results, 
                  predict=c("probability", "class"))
```
