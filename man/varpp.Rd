\title{Based on the original VARPP paper, this algorithm is the parallelised and updated version of the model}
\usage{
varpp(HPO_genes, type = "gtex", ntree = 500, max.depth = NULL, cores = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{HPO_genes}{HPO term associated list of genes}

\item{type}{the prediction data; either hcl (single cell) or gtex (tissue specific)}

\item{ntree}{is the number of trees that should be built for ranger. It defaults to 1000}

\item{max.depth}{is the maximum tree depth for the ranger trees. IT defaults to 3.}

\item{cores}{number of cores for parallel, defaults to 4}
